### Overview 
1. Advanced Docker Concepts Lecture


#### What is Docker?  
1. ```docker run image ``` runs an image which is locally saved (cached) in your machine. If it can't find that image in your machine, it looks for one in Dockerhub, downloads to your machine, and spins up a container from that image.
2. ```Dockerhub``` is where people upload```image``` for everyone to use. 
3. An ```image``` is the perfect sandwich. ```images``` are created with a ```build``` command, they produce a ```container``` when started with ```run```. 
4. The clones of ```image``` or a perfect sandwich is the ```container```. You can spin up as many containers from an image as you want without affecting the perfect sandwich. 
5. ```docker run image```does two things: 
     - [] ```docker images``` downloads image from dockerhub if it doesn't exist in your local machine
     - [] ```docker ps -a``` displayes all the containers in your machine.
     - []  ```-a``` flag displays all the containers running and stopped, whereas ```docker ps -a``` only displays running containers. 
6. Spinning a brand new ```container``` with a brand new ```image```: ```docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginx```
     - ```docker run``` creates a new container from an image.
     - ```nginx``` the name of the image to spin into a container.
     -  ```--name webserver``` gives the container a unique name to indentify it
     -  ```-p 80:80``` connect port 80 on the host to port 80 on the container.
     -  ```d``` runs your container in a detached state, meaning it runs in the background.
7. ```docker stop webserver``` to stop a container called webserver.
8. ```docker start webserver``` to start a container called webserver.
9. ```docker rm webserver``` to remove a container. Note, container has to be stopped to be removed. ```docker rm conatinerx containery``` to remove multiple containers at once.
10. ```docker rm -f webserver``` to force a running container to be removed. 
11. ```docker run -d -p 80:80 -rm --name goodbye nginx``` builds a container called goodbye from image called nginx and when ```docker stop goodbye``` it gets removed on its own. 
12. ```docker rmi imagename``` to remove an image. Note, remove containers before removing images. 
13. ```docker images``` to see all the images in your machine. 
14. ```docker info``` to get a status report of all the images and containers in your machine. 

#### Containerize your app with Docker
1. Dockerfile is the receipe that image (aka perfect sandwich) uses. 
2. To build an image from scratch that could be spun into a container that runs node.js:  
      -  Build from Ubuntu image > 
      -  Update Ubuntu > 
      -  Install Node > 
      -  Add Working Directory > 
      -  Copy app into working Directory > 
      -  Install Dependencies
