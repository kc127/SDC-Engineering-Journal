1. Advanced Docker Concepts Lecture


#### Docker 
1. ```docker run image ``` runs an image which is locally saved (cached) in your machine. If it can't find that image in your machine, it looks for one in Dockerhub, downloads to your machine, and spins up a container from that image.
2. ```Dockerhub``` is where people upload```image``` for everyone to use. 
3. An ```image``` is the perfect sandwich. ```images``` are created with a ```build``` command, they produce a ```container``` when started with ```run```. 
4. The clones of ```image``` or a perfect sandwich is the ```container```. You can spin up as many containers from an image as you want without affecting the perfect sandwich. 
5. ```docker run image```does two things: 
     - [] ```docker images``` downloads image from dockerhub if it doesn't exist in your local machine
     - [] ```docker ps -a``` creates a new container, and runs it 
     - []  ```-a``` flag displays all the containers running and stopped, whereas ```docker ps -a``` only displays running containers.
