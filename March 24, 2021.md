#### To Deploy, I am using 

- EC2 (compute) + S3 (storage) + IAM (security)

#### Deployment Process
1. ```docker cp pathtofiles/. container:/tmp```
2. ```mysql dump```
3. ```sudo rm -r -f file_name``` to delete a file
4. ```sudo rm -r -f package-lock.json/``` to delete a folder
5. ```scp -i /sdc.pem file_name.csv ec2instancelinke:tmp/file_name.csv;```
6. ```sudo usermod -a -G docker ubuntu```
7. SCP, another and much better way to transfer csvs to your ubuntu instance. 
8. I was wrong about S3, I thought S3 allowed me to access the files and not download them to ubuntu..https://haydenjames.io/linux-securely-copy-files-using-scp/

#### Step 1: Clone your repo from git 
1.  ```mkdir folder```
2.  ```git clone repo_url.git```

#### Step 2: Make sure to configure aws so that you have AWS access key
1. 6. https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials to create security credentials

#### Step 3: In Ubuntu 
1. Once step 2 is done, run ```aws configure``` and type in your aws access key.

#### Step 4: Downloading files from S3 to ubuntu
1. ```aws s3 sync s3://my-bucket/datasets/``` to move s3 bucket folder onto your local directory in ubuntu. 

#### Step 5: Download MySQL and usual process with schema, load etc.
