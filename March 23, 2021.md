9th Day of the Project! 

##### Things to Do Today
 
 1. S3 vs RDS - 
     [] what to use for storage and how ? 
     [] how to use it with Docker? 
     [] how to run forever.js 
     
 2. InfluxDB + Grafana + k6 for testing 

##### Scaling Your Architecture Lecture Notes (Josh Elder 1:30 pm)

1. What is an architecture? blueprint which is based on decision which can be costly or difficult to change once implemented.
2. With microservice architecture, we can scale individually. 

SCALING: Vertical or Horizontal 

1. What and Why Scale? to handle uptick increasing numbers of users, to handle traffic
2. Resources allocated use go up when there is uptick of users, and users start experiencing degradation - for example: slowness of website
3. 100ms of increased response can drive users away, there providing optimal user experience is important. 
4. IBM, google, cloud services providers auto-scaling. https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/

LOAD BALANCER

1. is a traffic cop to reqs coming into your app, routes request (round robin type of situation)
2. is a server application
3. can be written in javascript
4. js is faster type of slow language (faster than python but not super fast..)
5. loadbalancer are apps designed to be extremely performant, mainly written in C because C is super fast
6. e.g nginx(engine-x) is an example of loadbalancer, can be used as a filesystem, proxy not just load balancer
7. LoadBalancing Strategies: 
     [] IP Hash - client sends a req to LD, LD hashes that IP, sends that to one of the instances of the servers
     [] Round Robin
     [] Docker swarm (also uses a loadbalancer) - also can be used - relatively easy to scale an app
