#### Raw notes on Loading the csv files into database (ideas)
1. Extract: Import the raw csv files. 
2. Transformation: Clean the data - first read the file, write the file into new csv files. 
3. Save the original version of csv, create a different csv for a clean version. So something like fs.readFile, and fs.writeFile
4. Load: Load the new data csv files using https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html
5. Some notes from impromtu cohort meeting: 
     - SET GLOBAL local_infile = true; 
7. Set Default values such as empty string
