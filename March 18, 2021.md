### Overview 
Today is 4/14 day of the project. 
- Performance Testing Lecture by Josh Elder 9 am 
- Standup at 10 am 

#### Performance Testing Lecture 
- ProTip: Find tools that let you monitor CPU / memory usage on different layers to figure out where your bottleneck is. 
- There are many tools you can design / use on different layers to help diagnose the problem.
- https://k6.io/ for Load Testing 
- ProTip: Write Error logging middleware (also if you are working with other software ie database / load balancer, etc they wrote it and you can see errors learn they show)
- ProTip: Also make sure you are not caching you queries. Make sure to not repeat queries and to load test randomly generated routes, not the same route over and over. All databases have native caching so testing the same route over and over is different than testing new routes. 
If you want to test cached routes do that explicitly.
- What is Materialized View?
