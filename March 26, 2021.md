### 12th Day of the Project 

Today is all about Testing? 

##### What is Throughput? 

- amount of transactions produced over time during a test. It's also expressed as the amount of capacity that a website or application can handle. 

##### Stress test in Development (1k RPS) No Optimization

##### SDC Final Conversations 
- Practice Interview Questions 
- Tell me about a project you recently worked on (2 -3 mins)
   - not an outline the entire project 
   - but more like highlighing important aspects
   - work from an outline - be super familiar with facts, numbers, 

- CAR Framework: 
    - What does the interviewer want to know about you? 
    - How you handle adversity, how you make decision (whether to prioritize FE or scalability)
    - How well you handle stress 
    - Learning technologies as one of our challenges is not a good challenge. 
    - Choose topics where Results (R) could be objectively measured, examples 
         - took some engineering decision 
         - optimizing things that made things better 
         - increased throughput underload (100 to 300)
         - separated db from server
         - I sharded my db why
         - I used redis caching why  
         - why did you choose to scale and not cache 
         - did you add load balancer in front of the server why
         - try not to emphazize your group's contribution 
         - try to emphasize your contribution mostly 
         - try not to talk about financial contribution
     - Not super important => what this service did 
     - purpose of the application is not important 
     - start optimizing and scaling the architecture -> most meaningful thing you can do , provides numerical benefit in terms of 
     - What is scaling 
         - stress test without loadbalancer -> how much throughput can it handle , figure out what the bottleneck is 
         - is your db falling behind, where is the bottleneck (select statement for example, by indexing)
         - if server is the bottleneck -> adding more server with loadbalancer is the solution
         - the key is to figure out the bottleneck 

    
   #### Questions about SDC
   
   - New relic - if load is 50/50
   - client (group of get, post, put) per second vs request (just one request) per second 
   - caching has a more effect on database than on server 
   - caching is targeted fix for database
   - why is cache faster than database? - because storage is slower cheaper than memory, cache is faster but more expensive 
   - implementing cache is very little code, x perfomance increase -> what was the cache hit rate (not a good rep if too high) or if too low (not good) 
   - 70% is the cache rate you want to hit 
   - if you have db bottleneck, try caching first 
   - How to handle streams: how streams work in node, what a chunk is, how to drain things 
   - Common interview questions ^^
